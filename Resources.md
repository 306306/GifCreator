#### People with problems
[Java se 6 - looping problems](https://www.java.net/node/664899 "[JAI-IMAGEIO] Wirting image metadata to control animated gif")

### In case we ever need an encoder...
[ACME Gif Encoder](http://www.acme.com/java/software/Acme.JPM.Encoders.GifEncoder.html "Class Acme.JPM.Encoders.GifEncoder")


### People who beat me to it...
[Elliot Kroo](http://elliot.kroo.net/software/java/GifSequenceWriter/ "Wouldn't be able to achieve a lot without his help")

[StackOverflow - imageio](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/777947/creating-animated-gif-with-imageio "Where I found Elliot in the first place")

[Benjamin Braga](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20318146/java-gif-creator-needs-tweeking "No cheating! Dont use his code as it is lame to do so. (Code reusal? Yeah right...)") This dude probably stole the code from Elliot Kroo and removed his credits/lincense on stack overflow. The code is the same, just without as many linebreaks and changed variable names. Pretty much how we used to cheat in school; copy texts, paraphrase a little and replace some words. Weak.
